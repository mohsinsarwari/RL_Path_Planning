# RL_Path_Planning

To load conda environment, run conda env create -f environment.yml

Things to do:

- Evaluate Performance on different desired paths
- Find source of jittery-ness by adjusting one variable at a time
- Figure out how to use tensorboard (check actor-critic loss)
- Evaluate best model vs final model


Later:
- Update Reward to be 1 - e^-r
- Train models on different total times; evaluate on same total_time
